# Guess the Song
In some Estonian gymnasiums, there is a test called "Music Seminar," where students are required to guess the names of songs to earn good grades. The "Guess the Song" project is designed to assist students in preparing for this test. The desktop application displays four song names and plays one of the songs. Students can then make their guess as to which song is being played. The purpose of this project is to provide students with practice and repetition to improve their skills for the test.
